I have removed Payment method page because client in his file write he want to discuss this page with you
When you want to publish this website then uncomment the footer part where links is present then footer will automatically works fine when you upload this website. I have move the question div to the left but I don't like this if you agree with me , then you can remove ml-5 from .question-holder  and add  .text-center with .content
